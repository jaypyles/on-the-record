"Read All The Lyrics To Tame Impala’s New Album ‘Deadbeat’
","It’s the long-awaited follow-up to 2020’s ‘The Slow Rush.’
",tame_impala.jpg,Alternative,10/17/25,Tame Impala,"“Ty Dolla $ign isn’t the only musician returning today after a five-year break in solo albums. Tame Impala, the recording project of Kevin Parker, is back with *Deadbeat*, the follow-up to 2020’s *The Slow Rush*.\n\nIn the years since his last album, Parker has become a father, written music for some movies (*Barbie*, *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Minions*) and collaborated with the likes of Justice and Thundercat.\n\nParker is known as a studio rat and a perfectionist, but on this album—inspired by the “bush doof” rave scene of Western Australia—he decided to take a different approach.\n\n“I was just really drawn into sounds that were quite… just really simple and stripped back and like sometimes distorted,” Kevin told Australia’s triple j radio. “Because I think for someone like me who’s sort of always obsessed with songs and sounds are like this expansive pop thing. I always just love the opposite of that, the pendulum swing in the other way.””",Ken Partridge,release
Joji Struggles To Connect On New Song “PIXELATED KISSES”,It’s his first new music since 2022.,joji.jpg,Alternative,10/14/25,Joji,"“It’s been three years since Joji released his third studio album, 2022’s *SMITHEREENS*, but today, the Japanese Australian singer, rapper, songwriter, and producer is back with “PIXELATED KISSES,” a self-produced, self-written rumination on love in the time of smartphones.\n\n“PIXELATED KISSES” is built on bleak, grinding synths and booming drums that contrast with Joji’s hypnotic melody. The song only has two parts—a chorus and a post-chorus—and in the first of them, Joji tries to connect with his lover from the other side of the globe. They’re completely dependent on technology, and there’s something cold about their interactions, even when everything is working properly.\n\nOn the post-chorus, Joji can’t get a read on how this other person is actually feeling. There might be a service outage, or it might just be that it’s impossible to communicate certain emotions on a tiny screen.”",Ken Partridge,release
50 Cent Defends Using AI To Remix His Own Music: ‘I Really Like Those Songs!’,,50.jpg,Rap,10/20/25,50 Cent,"“50 Cent‘s AI remixes aren’t just light-hearted fun — they help to showcase his musical genius in a new light, according to the man himself.\n\nThe G-Unit boss recently dabbled in the artificial intelligence trend by posting computer-generated renditions of “21 Questions” and “God Gave Me Style” that reimagined them as 1960s Motown-inspired anthems.\n\nThe move may have ruffled a few feathers given how controversial AI is in music, but if you ask 50, he’ll tell you there’s a lesser-known benefit to giving rap songs the AI remix treatment.\n\n“I really like those songs!” he told *Complex*. “Look, it will reach someone that I missed. Someone who couldn’t hear what I was trying to say to them in the writing can hear it now that it’s in that format. They’ll go, ‘Oh, yo! Play that again!’”\n\nFif added: “I don’t know where AI get these voices from, but these are some good voices! If these guys came out in that time period, they would have been competition for the guys that were there.”\n\nPressed for his thoughts on the growing concerns over AI, the *Power* mogul — ever the entrepreneur — said: “I don’t like fighting fights that I can’t win. I don’t think you can beat AI; I think you need to go with it.\n\n“I think we need to look at how we create businesses that work well with it and perform faster and progress as [AI] progresses because it’s not gonna stop progress.”\n\n50 Cent’s argument about his AI remixes making his songs more accessible to a wider audience checks out. Do a quick scan of his Instagram posts and you’ll see dozens of comments praising his songwriting ability and melodic sensibilities.\n\n“This proves how great of a songwriter 50 is. Great writing works no matter the melody,” one fan commented, while another said: “Proof that every timeline still finds a way to make him iconic.”\n\nThere were also plenty of jokes, too, with one aspiring comedian writing: “Curtis Jackson & The Units.” Someone else quipped: “Nat King Curt.”\n\n50 hinted that there might be more where these came from, captioning one of his posts: “Now this shit is hot 🔥 I’m a use AI on all my unreleased songs and see what I got for ya!””

"Twenty One Pilots’ “Breach” encourages growth, grace
",,breach.jpg,Rock,09/16/25,Twenty One Pilots,"“After hearing Twenty One Pilots’ “Breach” for the first time, I immediately wanted to hear it again – backwards. The last four words, “Just try to be,” didn’t feel like a clean ending to me, and I was stuck trying to figure out how we landed on that confusing imperative.\n\nTwenty One Pilots, made up of drummer Josh Dun and vocalist Tyler Joseph, uses their music both to validate the listener and to push them to grow, and in the wake of the final song “Intentions,” I wasn’t sure how I felt. But I felt comfortable trusting the heavily autotuned songs to say something important about my humanity.\n\nThe release of “Breach” was profoundly hyped: the album is the final chapter of a partially extramusical narrative that began with TOP’s “Blurryface.” In case you don’t have time to catch up on the lore, I will be judging this album on how relatable it is to the Rice listener. Does the music meet you where you are? And can it make you want to change?\n\n“Entertain my faith,” Joseph demands in “City Walls,” the album’s first song. “City Walls” is about trying to find an opening, and the scariness of going after something as a leader rather than a follower. The song introduces a quest to become a better person, but the album acknowledges that we’re not working in a vacuum.\n\n“RAWFEAR” is a reminder that there isn’t always space for our quests or even our fears. “Drum Show” is sung by a driver who’ll hit the gas or brakes to bargain with their demanding lifestyle, avoiding feelings and home.\n\nHiding out in shame is a theme throughout “Breach,” but because the album is so catchy, it doesn’t shame the listener for the lyrics they relate to. In songs like “The Contract,” Joseph echoes lines about the same unhealthy coping mechanisms over and over, without romanticization or judgement. “I don't sleep much, that's crazy, how'd you know that? / Keep myself up,” he sings, his voice distorted gently.\n\nHe admits to having breached contracts, but skirts further mention of his guilt until “Downstairs,” the album’s longest song, where he asks for help.\n\nThe addressee of “Downstairs” could be a friend or family member, but it’s far more likely the mercy the speaker asks for is divine. “I want to be the one after your own heart,” he sings, calling himself a “dirty and wretched one.”\n\nIn the following song, “Robot Voices,” he finds genuine love, and reassuring robot voices are credited as helpers. It does feel like we just went from a song about God to a song about robots. But we also went from a song about hiding to one about being found.”
